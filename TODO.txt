1. Add the ability to use headings, italics, bold letters as well as several different fonts. (1/2 Done, it's in the editorFunction header file)
2. Create a toolbar to use above functions. Got the creation process down, just have to modify it to suit my needs. (Again 1/2 done)
3. Add user settings. (Not started)
4. File IO (Just started, got the basics down and just have to get it to save and read files)
